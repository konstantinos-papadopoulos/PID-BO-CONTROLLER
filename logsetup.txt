To finish project setup:

1. Change the `classifiers' keyword in `setup.py' as necessary.
2. Change the license in `setup.py' and replace the generated `LICENSE' file
   with the one of your choice. If you would like to use the MIT license, no
   change is necessary.
3. Install `argparse' package when developing on Python 2.6.
4. Change `README.rst' to your own text.
